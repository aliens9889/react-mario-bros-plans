# Mario Bros Plans

This React project is a light twitter (well that's how I see it) as user you will add projects and add some details about it, besides this project will handle authentication with Firebase (I think is awesome!).

# Important

The original project is by **The Net Ninja** you can check his Youtube's channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) and you can find so much more that you feel interested.

Why this part is considerate important? Because if you want to follow the original tutorial, you can check **The Net Ninja** github's project [here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/React-Redux-Firebase-App). There is something that some people on his youtube's channel comments about this project, that they (as me at beginning) were following the tutorial step by step, video by video and don't considerate that the Firebase version would be an important step to move forward with the tutorial.

At first I was thinking that probably I was doing something wrong or probably I missed something in the process, but then, after suffered for a little while lol. I found out (searching on Internet) that the last version on Firebase (V3) has changed some things in compare with Firebase V2. In my mind I was saying: Ok, that means you have two options:

- One. If you want to continue with the tutorial you have to install the dependencies with the same version like **The Net Ninja** tutorial and his github's repository has it. This option is good, and will be a reminder if you follow the next tutorial from him or other tutorial, that be aware with the dependencies and versions of x projects.

- Two. Keep the project and move forward with all current dependencies, but you have to figure it out how to make work the project.

So I thought: Ok **The Net Ninja** already has the project with Firebase version 2 (V2). I could do the same project but with the Firebase next's version (V3). That way me and others developers can get more info about how to handle this project with the most recent changes. So I took it as a personal challenge (it was hard, but I think this second option was the best decision for me).

Once you have this very very clear, then we can move on.

What I like about this project is it's handle different elements that would be helpful for other project that you could have in mind or this will good as guide for next projects. Elements like: Redux, React Router DOM, React Redux Firebase, Redux Firestore, Redux Thunk (I know probably is a lot, but it will worth it to practice and learn new stuff)

I will work with **Yarn** to install dependencies and run the project. Feel free if you prefer work with **NPM** it is good too.

If the is another tips that I think is important to everyone or as reminder to myself I will add it here (That's with you Alonso, don't be lazy when you considerate something important add it on Readme, ok? Ok, don't yelling me lol).

# Reminder

- The big change between Firebase - Firestore (V2) with (V3) is how you have to configurate the **index.js** file. This is **VERY IMPORTANT** if you want to keep going with this version of the project.
- Before you start with the project you have to create a project on [Firebase's website](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- You will get the firebase config once you created the firebase project. that info you will put it on the **index.js**
- Check if you have installed the most recent firebase on your machine, if you don't I advice you to do it.
- If you have installed it or you already have the most recent firebase version on your machine check if you are login. If you installed recently the new version I recommend to do **firebase logout** and then do the **firebase login**, that way you can accept the terms of firebase. Or if you start with this type this command first **firebase init**
- When you are configurating the firebase in you console machine I selected the **functions and hosting** options
- When you are in the firbase console I put the public folder **dist**
- Once you run build the project I move the build content to **dist folder**
- The process with this project is almost exact as the original (the net ninja) except the steps that I'm showing you
- If you compare my code with the net ninja there are some difference and some adds. Feel free to work on the project as you prefer. if you like one way than other, that's good or if you like to do it in a way you considerate better, that will be cool!!! (Actually let us check it lol).
